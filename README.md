# Timed-Unsupervised-Learning-Project
The goal for this assignment was to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This required to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret the results.

CASE INFORMATION

Windows or Mac?

Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.

 

Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Apple is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to details such as audience size.

 

DATA

Assume the data, including its demographics, are representative of the population Apple is attempting to study.


APPROACH

My team and I approached this problem systematically by first checking the data set for any missing or repeating values. After cleaning the data we went onto conducting basic analysis using pivot tables on R and plotting graphs to visualize the data to look for trend changes or any other things that are worth looking in to. Finally we applied a 5 Personality Traits Formula which reflected the variables in the data set to simplify our understanding of hw to interpret the data based on five personalities instead of each variable individually. After we created a PCA Model and conducted Factor Loadings Analysis for Psychometrics. Concluding we visualized the resultes and thoroughly analyzed it to derive valuable insights.
